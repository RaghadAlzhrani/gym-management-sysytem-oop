Group members: Raghad Alzahrani, Esra Saif, Rafaa Alobaid, Maram khoj and Ahlam Almatrafi
review: This gym management system was designed using object-oriented programming by applying all its concepts!
The system was made to deal with both the trainers and members. to manage the trainers’ affairs, to help members in bookings, and to assist the new clients to join by taking their personal information, the clients have different packages to choose from, they differ in features, some of them offer a dietary plan and give access to different number of sports. Each sport has a maximum number of trainees, only one trainer, fixed durations. every trainer can train 1or 3 (at most) sports.
All to achieve the institution’s goals with no mistakes
